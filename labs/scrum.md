# Assignment: Scrum Board and Issue Management in Jira

## Objective
The purpose of this assignment is to familiarize you with creating, configuring, and managing Scrum boards in Jira. You will be asked to consider the perspectives of various team roles (team member, Scrum Master, and Product Owner) while managing different types of issues and discussing the best path forward.

## Background
A software development team is working on a project called "Project Phoenix". The team follows the Scrum agile development methodology. Your task is to create a Scrum board for them in Jira based on their project workflow and manage several pre-defined issue types.

## Scrum Workflow:
1. **Backlog:** All new issues start here. 
2. **To Do:** Issues that are prioritized for the upcoming Sprint.
3. **In Progress:** Work on the issue begins.
4. **Code Review:** Developers review the completed work for quality and adherence to standards.
5. **Testing:** The QA team tests the issue for bugs or other problems.
6. **Done:** The issue is resolved, tested, and ready for deployment.

## Assignment:

1. Login to your Jira account and navigate to your project, "Project Phoenix".
2. Click on "Create Board" and select "Create a Scrum board".
3. Name your board "Phoenix Scrum" and ensure it's connected to your project.
4. Go to the "Columns" section in your board settings. Here you'll create new columns representing each state of your workflow.
5. Create the following columns corresponding to the workflow states: "Backlog", "To Do", "In Progress", "Code Review", "Testing", "Done". Ensure that they are in this exact order.
6. Go to the "Workflow" section in your board settings. Map each column to the corresponding status. Note: You might need to edit the workflow scheme if the existing workflow statuses do not match your columns. You can do this by going to Project settings -> Workflows.
7. Once your workflow is set, create the following issue types for the project, providing a realistic use case scenario for each:

    - **Story:** As a user, I want to have a profile page so that I can customize my information.
    - **Bug:** Users are reporting that the profile images are not loading correctly on the new UI.
    - **Task:** Migrate user data to the new database schema.
    - **Epic:** Overhaul of the user interface for a better user experience.

8. Now, consider the following scenarios and discuss how to manage these issues considering the perspective of:

    - The team: What steps would they need to take to resolve these issues? What obstacles might they face?
    - The Scrum Master: How would they facilitate the workflow, remove obstacles, and support the team?
    - The Product Owner: How would they prioritize these issues in the Product Backlog? What considerations would they need to take into account to ensure maximum value delivered to the customers?

Remember, the goal is not just to build the board and create issues, but to understand the dynamics of the Scrum team and how to effectively manage the workflow and product development. Use this as an opportunity to explore the features Jira has to offer and deepen your understanding of the Scrum methodology. Happy learning!

Now add additional complexity:

    - **Story:** As a user, I want to share my profile with others so that I can network.
    - **Bug:** The share profile feature is causing the app to crash intermittently.
    - **Task:** Add performance metrics to the app.
    - **Epic:** Integration of a new networking module.

9. Now, for each of these issues:

    - Link related issues. For instance, link the bug "The share profile feature is causing the app to crash intermittently" to the story "As a user, I want to share my profile with others so that I can network."
    - Add relevant notes to each issue to provide context, or important information that could assist in its resolution.
    - Add labels to help categorize your issues. For example, you could use labels like "UI", "backend", "critical", etc. to help sort and prioritize the issues.

10. Start a new sprint and move the prioritized issues from the backlog to the "To Do" column.

11. Discuss how to manage these issues considering the perspective of:

    - The team: What steps would they need to take to resolve these issues? What obstacles might they face?
    - The Scrum Master: How would they facilitate the workflow, remove obstacles, and support the team?
    - The Product Owner: How would they prioritize these issues in the Product Backlog? What considerations would they need to take into account to ensure maximum value delivered to the customers?

12. Progress through the sprint, moving issues to the appropriate columns as work is completed.

13. At the end of the sprint, close the sprint in Jira, analyze the sprint report, and reflect on what went well and what could be improved.

14. Plan for the next sprint: re-prioritize the backlog, create a new sprint in Jira, and move the selected issues into the new sprint.

Remember, the goal is not just to build the board and create issues, but to understand the dynamics of the Scrum team, how to effectively manage the workflow and product development, and how to utilize Jira to its fullest potential.
